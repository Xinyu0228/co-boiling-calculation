# NAPL Removal Quantification Tool during Co-boiling

This repository contains code used to quantify the removal of NAPL (Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid) and to establish the relationship between NAPL removal and the temperature field. This code is adapted from the methodologies and research findings presented in several academic papers.
